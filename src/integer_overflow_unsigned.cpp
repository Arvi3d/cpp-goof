// Summary: Unsigned Integer Overflow
// Unsigned integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation on unsigned
// integers results in a value outside their representable range. In C++,
// this is well-defined: the result wraps around (modulo 2^N, where N is
// the number of bits in the type). For example, if the maximum value for an
// unsigned int is 4294967295, adding 1 to it results in 0. While defined,
// this wrap-around can lead to logical errors, incorrect program behavior,
// and security vulnerabilities if not handled or expected, especially in
// calculations for buffer sizes, array indices, or financial computations.

#include <iostream>
#include <limits> // Required for std::numeric_limits

void demonstrate_unsigned_overflow() {
    unsigned int max_val = std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max();
    std::cout << "Max unsigned int: " << max_val << std::endl;
    unsigned int result_add = max_val + 1; // Wraps around to 0
    std::cout << "Max unsigned int + 1 (wraps to): " << result_add << std::endl;

    unsigned int zero_val = 0;
    unsigned int result_sub = zero_val - 1; // Wraps around to max_val
    std::cout << "0 - 1 (wraps to): " << result_sub << std::endl;
}

// Mitigation Strategy:
// To prevent or handle unintended unsigned integer overflows:
// 1. Use Larger Data Types: If values might exceed the range, employ a larger
//    unsigned type (e.g., `unsigned long long` instead of `unsigned int`).
// 2. Pre-computation Checks: Before an operation, verify if it will overflow.
//    For addition (a + b): check if `a > std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max() - b`.
//    For multiplication (a * b): if `a == 0`, no overflow. Else, check if `b > std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max() / a`.
// 3. Careful Design: Understand where wrap-around is acceptable or part of
//    the algorithm (e.g., some hashing, cryptography) and where it's a bug.
//    Document such intended behaviors clearly.
// 4. Compiler Warnings & Sanitizers: Enable compiler warnings (e.g., `-Wconversion`
//    though it can be noisy). Use sanitizers like Clang/GCC's
//    UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan) with `-fsanitize=unsigned-integer-overflow`
//    during development to catch unintended wrap-around.
// 5. Static Analysis: Utilize static analysis tools that can identify potential
//    integer overflow conditions based on data flow.
// 6. Input Validation: Rigorously validate external inputs to ensure they won't
//    cause unexpected wrap-around in critical calculations.
// 7. Testing: Test with boundary values (max unsigned int, 0) that are
//    likely to cause overflow or underflow wrap-around.
// 8. Avoid Mixing Signed and Unsigned: Be extremely cautious when performing
//    arithmetic with mixed signedness, as implicit conversions can lead to
//    surprising results and overflows. Prefer consistent use of either
//    signed or unsigned types within a specific calculation context.
